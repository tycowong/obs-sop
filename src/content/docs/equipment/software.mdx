We'll take a dive into the software you'll use to record and manage equipment. We will not go over every single thing each piece of software does. This section will only focus on key components you need to know in order to start the recording.

## Camera Software

In order to be able to control the cameras, you'll need a PTZ controller and the Logitech's webcam software LogiTune.

##p PTZOptics Camera Control

### Camera Configuration

You need to configure the cameras in the software in order to control them.

<Aside type="tip">
  You can have **multiple instances of PTZOptics Camera Control open.** It would
  be recommended to **have one instance open for each camera.**
</Aside>

Here you can configure multiple cameras and their type of communication (IP or USB)

Lets go over how to **configure a PTZ camera.**

<Aside>Make sure your camera is plugged in.</Aside>

<Steps>

1. From the **Settings Tab,** select **Multi Camera Setting.**

2. In the **Camera1** box, make sure your PTZ camera is showing and select **USB Camera**

3. Click the **OK** button

4. In the home screen, Click **Camera1**

   <Aside>
     This is not automatically clicked, make sure its selected before trying to
     reposition the PTZ camera.
   </Aside>

5. Try moving the PTZ camera using the **arrows**

</Steps>

### Main Home Screen Controls

<div class="center">
  ![controls ui box screenshot](./../../../assets/ptzoptics-control.png)
</div>

The arrows allow you to **pan and tilt.**

<Card title="Arrow Controls">
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Up Arrow" icon="up-arrow">
      Tilt the camera upwards.
      <Aside>
        We usually have the PTZ cameras upside down, so the tilt directions will
        be flipped around.
      </Aside>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Down Arrow" icon="down-arrow">
      Tilt the camera downwards.
      <Aside>
        We usually have the PTZ cameras upside down, so the tilt directions will
        be flipped around.
      </Aside>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Left Arrow" icon="left-arrow">
      Pan the camera to the left.
      <Aside>
        We usually have the PTZ cameras upside down, so the pan directions will
        be flipped around.
      </Aside>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Right Arrow" icon="right-arrow">
      Pan the camera to the right.
      <Aside>
        We usually have the PTZ cameras upside down, so the tilt directions will
        be flipped around.
      </Aside>
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
</Card>

If you want to **Zoom in or out** use the following

<Card title="Zoom Controls">
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Magnifying Glass +" icon="magnifier">
      Zoom or punch **in**
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Magnifying Glass  -" icon="magnifier">
      Zoom or punch **out**
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
</Card>

<Aside type="caution">
  The **+** and **-** buttons are for **exposure** but our cameras do not have
  that feature
</Aside>

## LogiTune

This software allows you to change the exposure, sharpness, focus, or other setting from the Logitech Brio webcam.

![Logitune logo image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0567/7599/9639/files/logitunes-1680576825130.webp?v=1697623472)

### Image Adjustment

This software is pretty straight forward.

<Steps>
  1. Connect your Logitech Brio webcam.

2. Open LogiTune and select the webcam you want to adjust.

3. Click on **_Click here to start the preview_** to
   preview your changes.

4. Close the app.

   <Aside type="caution">
     This is important so that you can see the webcam in OBS, otherwise it will
     not show up.
   </Aside>

</Steps>

<Aside>
  If you don't see the changes applied in OBS, open LogiTune again and select
  the webcam. This will refresh the adjustments made.
</Aside>

The next software we will talk about its **OBS.** Since this is the software you'll be using for **capturing audio and video,** this requires it's own section.
