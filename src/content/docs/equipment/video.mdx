Here we will talk about our **PTZ cameras and webcams** available. This should be a short section since there's only two models and **most of the interaction with the cameras will be cover in the Software section.**

**PTZ** stands for Pan, Tilt and Zoom.

      Movement from **let to right**
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Tilt" icon="up-arrow">
      **Up and Down** movement
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Zoom" icon="seti:code-search">
      Close in on a subject, or **zoom** out
    </TabItem>

These are the three types of **movement** the camera can perform. This will allow you to position them anywhere you want.

This is a USB PTZ camera that transmits video through a USB cable.

<Aside>
  The USB Cable does not transmit power, you will need to use the included
  external power source
</Aside>

There's not much more with this camera, you control everything using software. We will talk about software later.

## Webcam

You'll have access to only one webcam, the Logitech Brio.

This is a USB 4k webcam that delivers video over USB 3.0. Power and video will de deliver over the same USB 3.0 cable.

<Aside>
  If you do not have a video feed, make sure you are using a 3.0 cable. Also
  make sure you are plugging the webcam into a 3.0 port in the computer
</Aside>

That's all for video, next we will talk about software.
