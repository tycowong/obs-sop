## Environment setup

The first time you open OBS you'll maybe see a profile already loaded with scenes and sources. If you want with a fresh profile and scene collection follow this steps.

### Setup a Recording profile

A **Profile** are preset settings that will change the way OBS works.

For our case, we want it to be setup for recording by doing the following

<Steps>

1. Click on the **Profile** tab
   ![Scene Collection tab screenshot](./../../../assets/profile-menu.png)

2. Select **New**

3. Give your profile a name and click the **OK** button

4. Select the option **Optimize for recording, I will not be streaming**
   ![Choose type of profile screenshot](./../../../assets/recording-or-streaming.png)

5. Click the **Next** button

6. Choose your desired resolution and FPS
   ![choose resolution screenshot in OBS](./../../../assets/resolution-setting.png)

7. Click the **Next** button

8. Double check you settings, if everything looks good select **_Apply Settings_**

 </Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  It may not seem like anything happen, but now your OBS is setup for recording.
</Aside>

### New Scene Collection

A **Scene Collection** is all the scenes, video inputs, audio inputs, etc.

If you already have one that works for you use it.

If you want to start with a clean slate do the following

<Steps>

1. Click the **Scene Collection** tab

2. Select the **New** option
   ![Scene Collection tab screenshot](./../../../assets/scene-collection-menu.png)

3. Give your Scene Collection a name

4. Click the **OK** button

</Steps>

Now you'll see a clean OBS Scene Collection without any inputs and a default **_Scene_** in the Scenes section in the bottom left side of the window.

<Aside type="danger" title="Important">
  Changing Scene Collection **does not automatically change your Profile,**
  these are treated separately and are not interchangeable.
</Aside>

## Scenes

Think of scenes as like a canvas where you can drop all of you inputs like video, audio, overlays, etc.

<div class="center">![Scenes Screenshot](./../../../assets/scenes.png)</div>

A scene contains a **collection of sources.**

This includes their position in the screen, size, audio inputs, muted inputs, etc.

<Aside type="tip">
  Treat Scenes as different camera angles, switching between scenes is easier
  than hiding and showing different cameras
</Aside>

## Sources

A **source is an input** like a screen capture, camera, HTML overlay, microphone, etc.

We are goin to cover only two sources
