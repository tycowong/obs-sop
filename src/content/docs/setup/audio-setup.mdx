Audio can look challenging but it's the simplest to setup!

<Steps>

1. Position the microphones where the most interaction is going to happen

2. Connect the microphones to the back of the audio interface using the included XLR adapter

4. Make sure it turns on and select the **48V and AIR** button

5. Talk, or have someone talk, into a mic to make sure it's being picked up by the interface.
   <Aside>
     If you the interface is on, but no sound is showing. Try turning the
     **gain** dial on the mics
