The position of the cameras it's important but there's some key points to have in mind.

## Mapping Cameras

In order to capture all the data needed it's imperative that you position the cameras were there's little overlapping with each other.

### Camera Position

<Aside>
  This will depend on the space you have available to you. Sometimes you may
  need to get creative with positioning if there's a limited amount of space.
</Aside>

Think about what you want to capture like.

As an example, imagine you want to capture **reactions and interactions.** You will need a number of angels for this:

- Front Face Shot
- Left Interaction Shot
- Right Interaction Shot
- Top Interaction Shot

Once you have this list you can discard what ever you don't need for your specific situation.

<Aside type="tip">

Don't be afraid to use other software to visualize your space. By knowing positions in advance you can reduce your setup time.
