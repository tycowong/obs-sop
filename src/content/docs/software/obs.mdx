</div>

## Functions

OBS can be used for lot's of things and therefore there's a broad selection of inputs and outputs but we are only goin to go over the one's we'll use.

## Environment setup

The first time you open OBS you'll maybe see a profile already loaded with scenes and sources. If you want with a fresh profile and scene collection follow this steps.

### Setup a Recording profile

A **Profile** are preset settings that will change the way OBS works.

For our case, we want it to be setup for recording by doing the following

<Steps>

1. Click on the **Profile** tab
   ![Scene Collection tab screenshot](./../../../assets/profile-menu.png)

2. Select **New**

3. Give your profile a name and click the **OK** button

4. Select the option **Optimize for recording, I will not be streaming**
   ![Choose type of profile screenshot](./../../../assets/recording-or-streaming.png)

5. Click the **Next** button

6. Choose your desired resolution and FPS
   ![choose resolution screenshot in OBS](./../../../assets/resolution-setting.png)

7. Click the **Next** button

8. Double check you settings, if everything looks good select **_Apply Settings_**

 </Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  It may not seem like anything happen, but now your OBS is setup for recording.
</Aside>

### New Scene Collection

A **Scene Collection** is all the scenes, video inputs, audio inputs, etc.

If you already have one that works for you use it.

If you want to start with a clean slate do the following

<Steps>

1. Click the **Scene Collection** tab

2. Select the **New** option
   ![Scene Collection tab screenshot](./../../../assets/scene-collection-menu.png)

3. Give your Scene Collection a name

4. Click the **OK** button

</Steps>

Now you'll see a clean OBS Scene Collection without any inputs and a default **_Scene_** in the Scenes section in the bottom left side of the window.

<Aside type="danger" title="Important">
  Changing Scene Collection **does not automatically change your Profile,**
  these are treated separately and are not interchangeable.
</Aside>

## Scenes

Think of scenes as like a canvas where you can drop all of you inputs like video, audio, overlays, etc.

<div class="center">![Scenes Screenshot](./../../../assets/scenes.png)</div>

A scene contains a **collection of sources.**

This includes their position in the screen, size, audio inputs, muted inputs, etc.

<Aside type="tip">
  Treat Scenes as different camera angles, switching between scenes is easier
  than hiding and showing different cameras
</Aside>

## Sources

A **source is an input** like a screen capture, camera, HTML overlay, microphone, etc.

We are goin to cover only two sources

   ![camera edit section in OBS](./../../../assets/camera-edit.png)

6. In the **Device** section, choose the camera you want to add

   <Aside>
     If you don't see the camera, make sure it's powered on and plugged into
     your computer. Then restart OBS and try again.
   </Aside>

7. In the **Resolution/FPS Type** section, choose **Custom**

8. In the **Resolution** section, choose the resolution of the camera you are adding

9. Click the **OK** button

10. You will now see your new camera source in the source section and the preview window

</Steps>

### Audio Source

When you want to add a microphone input you need to select the **_Audio Input Capture_** in the source section.

Here's how to add a microphone input in OBS

<Steps>

1. Locate the Source section in the bottom left side of OBS window

2. Click on the **+** button in the bottom left

There are additional steps you need to make since your audio interface might be in stereo mode.

<div class="center">
  ![Screenshot of Audio mixer in OBS](./../../../assets/audio-mixer-left.png)

    ![Fix audio setting](./../../../assets/audio-mixer-fix.png)

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Sometimes audio inputs disappear, if this happens, add them again or restart
  OBS
</Aside>

## Broadcasting and Recording

We will focus in the Control section that you can fin in the bottom right of the OBS window.

<div class="center">
  ![screenshot of Control section in OBS](./../../../assets/control-button.png)
</div>

We only need to focus in two buttons

- Strat Recording
- Start Virtual Camera

### Start Recording Button

This button will start a recording of all the sources in the selected scene.

<Aside type="caution">
  You can switch scenes while recording, just make sure the audio sources match
  between scenes. If you have a scene with microphone input and then switch to
  another scene without that microphone, you will loose sound in the recording.
</Aside>

After clicking this button, the button's text will changer to **Stop Recording** and a pause button will appear in the right.

<div class="center">
  ![screenshot of the start button press in
  obs](./../../../assets/recording-press.png)
</div>

These are self describing, but here's the actions of these buttons just in case.

<Card title="Stop and Pause">
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Stop Recording Button">
      This will pause the recording and will finish the video encoding.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Pause Button">
      This will pause the recording until you press the pause button again.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
</Card>

By default your recording are going into the **Videos** folder in your computer.

<Aside type="caution">
  If this is not the case click **File > Settings > Output** and you'll see
  under **Recording > Recording Path** the path were OBS is recording
</Aside>

### Video Format

There's different outputs the video encoder will let you choose from. By default the format of the video will be **mkv.**

Here's some benefits of using **mkv** vs **mp4**

|                  | MKV                                                                 | MP4                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| File size        | Larger files due to lossless compression                            | Smaller files due to efficient compression           |
| Compatibility    | Supports many codecs, but some devices may not support MKV natively | More widely compatible with most devices             |
| Video quality    | Higher quality due to lossless compression                          | Lower quality than MKV due to compression            |
| Features         | Supports multiple audio and subtitle tracks, chapters, and tags     | Supports fewer tracks and basic metadata             |
| Error resilience | Can recover from file corruption and play partial content           | Often makes the entire video unplayable if corrupted |

The most important feature is the **Error resilience.** If for some reason OBS or the computer crashes, the video format will be playable and readable up to the point where the app crashed.

<Aside type="danger">
  Although slim, there's still chance for the video to corrupt if any service
  stops. MKV it's just better for catastrophic events compared to mp4
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" label="Sharing Formats">

MKV format videos are **large**. In order to **reduce the size** you can
convert them into an **mp4 file.** You can use OBS for this by going to:

> **File > Remux Recordings > Button in the OBS Recording Section > Choose Recording > Remux.**

</Aside>

### Start Virtual Camera Button

This button will allow you to share your current OBS scene by creating a **Virtual Camera** that you can choose in Zoom, Teams, etc.

<div class="center">
  ![screenshot of zoom and obs virtual camera
  slected](./../../../assets/zoom-camera.png)
</div>

After clicking this button, the button's text will change to **Stop Virtual Camera.** Press this button to stop sharing your OBS feed.

<div class="center">
  ![screenshot of the Virtual Camera button
  pressed](./../../../assets/virtual-press.png)
</div>

<Aside type="caution">
  This will only share video and not audio. To share audio in Zoom or any other
  meeting app please select the audio interface as the microphone input.
</Aside>

## OBS Plugins

Plugins are a great way to enhance the functionality of OBS. You can find a bunch of them made by the community here:

  href="https://obsproject.com/forum/plugins/"

### Multiple Source and Scene Recording

By default OBS cannot record or stream separate sources and scenes at the same time. We can add this functionality by using a plugin called **Branch Output**

<Card title="Branch Output PLugin">
  <LinkCard
    title="OBS site"
    href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/branch-output-streaming-recording-filter-for-source-scene.1987/"
    description="Streaming/Recording filter for source/scene 1.0.2"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="GitHub Repo"
    href="https://github.com/OPENSPHERE-Inc/branch-output"
    description="Branch Output Repository"
  />
</Card>

This plugin allows you to can record each source individually. As a result, depending on the number of sources you wnat to record, this plugin will produced a video file per source.

<Aside>

As an example, if you have 2 camera sources you want to record, you will see 3
files:

- Scene Recording
- Source 1 Recording
- Source 2 Recording

</Aside>
