## Image Adjustment

This software is pretty straight forward.

  1. Connect your Logitech Brio webcam.

2. Open LogiTune and select the webcam you want to adjust.

3. Click on **_Click here to start the preview_** to
   preview your changes.

4. Close the app.

   <Aside type="caution">
     This is important so that you can see the webcam in OBS, otherwise it will
     not show up.

</Steps>

<Aside>
  If you don't see the changes applied in OBS, open LogiTune again and select
  the webcam. This will refresh the adjustments made.
